This project is under WTFPL.

It's a small project to test low level file writing in python.
It supposes that the data stream used to create the files is already well formed

As it used bitearray builtin type you must run a version of python from 3.2 and newer.

You can generate some files by running _bitmap_test.py_.

## TODO
Write class **BmpHeader** & class **BmpData** as extensions of **bitearray** builtin type.
Add all useful getter and setters in classes
Write a parser for BMP file and put the result on screen.
